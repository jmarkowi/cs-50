# cs-50
Contains the problem sets I completed for Harvard's free online CS-50 course through edX.

This code was originally written in and hosted on the CS50 IDE (https://ide.cs50.io).

### Scratch
The first assignment was to create a program on Scratch that involved (I think) multiple sprites, user interaction, and sound. It being June 2020, I made a game about the importance of wearing a mask to stop the spread of covid-19.

### C
*Problem sets (psets) 1-5 are written in C*
misc = handy little tidbits I wanted to remember and pieces of code to test
pset1 = hello, mario, cash, credit
pset2 = caesar, substitution, readability
pset3 = plurality, (and the infamous) tideman
pset4 = filter, recover (image processing)
pset5 = speller (linked lists!)

### Python
*After the incredible David Malan crushed our spirits by showing how much easier it would be to do all of that in Python, away we went*
pset6 = (redux!) mario, credit, readability, dna

### SQL
*A little SQL with that Python connection*
pset7 = houses, movies

*(And yes, there is also a final project after all of this. But I didn't get to that--the next school year was nigh and I had to start spending less time coding and more time planning for what would prove to be the most challenging year of teaching yet.)*

All in all, this is the best online or self-paced course I've ever taken. David is an incredible lecturer, the TAs are phenomenal at breaking down and explaining the projects and tough concepts, and the problem sets were just the right balance of challenging and achievable. It was incredibly rewarding and so much fun. (Except Tideman. That was incredibly frustrating. But also rewarding and fun.)
